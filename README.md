The creation of user-generated content is on the rise, and users are looking for more ways to personalize and add uniqueness to their creations. These creations are then shared to a vast network of devices, each with its own capabilities. The Jetpack Media3 1.0 release includes new functionality in the Transformer module for converting media files between formats, or transcoding, and applying editing operations. For example, you can trim a clip from a longer piece of media and apply effects to the video track to share over social media, or transcode media into a more efficient codec for upload to a server.

The overall goal of Transformer is to provide an easy to use, reliable and performant API for transcoding and editing media, including support for customizing functionality, following the same API design principles to ExoPlayer. The library is supported on devices running Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21) onwards and includes device-specific optimizations, giving developers a strong foundation to build on. This post gives an introduction to the new functionality and describes some of the many features we're planning for upcoming releases!
